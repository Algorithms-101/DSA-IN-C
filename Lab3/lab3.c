Write a program that will calculate the revenue of an electronics store for today’s sales.  
Your program will contain the price for each item and the sales tax – the only thing you need to ask the 
user is how much of each item was sold. Once your program has done that, you can calculate the 
revenue for each item (item amount sold * item price) and the total revenue of the store, before and 
after sales tax is applied.
